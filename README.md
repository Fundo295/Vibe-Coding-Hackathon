## 🌱 Agritech: Market Match Platform 
Connecting smallholder farmers to local markets using real-time price alerts and buyer matching. 

This project was developed as part of a hackathon , focusing on building impactful solutions with low-code development strategies , leveraging AI tools such as Claude AI , ChatGPT , and DeepSeek .

## 📋 Project Overview
Market Match is an agritech platform designed to solve the common problem faced by small-scale farmers — lack of market access and pricing information.

The solution helps farmers:

Get real-time updates about local market prices

Find nearby buyers or markets

Make informed decisions on when and where to sell

The project uses AI-assisted development , allowing rapid prototyping and ideation without requiring deep coding skills.
